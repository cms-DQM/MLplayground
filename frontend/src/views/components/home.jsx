              During a Run, the CMS Experiment collects particle collision data in Lumisection time-frame and the experiment
              subsystem health is monitored by shifters using DQMGUI. Multiple shifters for many subsystems monitor the most
              recent lumisection of the current run plots to check a subsystem's health, but given the number of plots and
              the limited manpower it is not possible to closely pay attention to all plots during the lumisection time-frame.
              On the other hand, using certified data it is possible to extract knowledge from old runs (at lumisection-level) to
              help shifters get a glimpse of detector's health on past runs.

              DIALS is an application designed to be an access point to DQMIO per-LS monitoring elements.
              It is responsible for indexing, storing pre-processed DQMIO data and serving via a WEB UI and
              REST Api, so that it could be used by any CMS sub-group for exploratory analysis, statistical learning and machine learning.

              This application was born in CMS Tracker ML as a prototype under the name "MLPlayground" and
              was centralized in CMS DQM-DC to be a common access point for every system.
